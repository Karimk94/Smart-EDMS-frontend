📚 EDMS Viewer Frontend
This is the frontend application for a modern Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). It's built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, leveraging Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and customizable user interface.

The application serves as a comprehensive viewer for documents and media, providing a seamless user experience for browsing, searching, and analyzing content.

✨ Features
Responsive Document Grid: A dynamically-loading, paginated grid view that adapts to any screen size.

Intuitive Search: Instantly search documents by title or other metadata.

High-Resolution Viewing: Open documents in a full-screen modal to view high-resolution images.

AI-Powered Face Analysis: Utilize an external service to detect and identify faces within documents.

Abstract Management: Easily update document abstracts with newly identified names, ensuring metadata is always up-to-date.

Seamless Data Flow: The application is designed to automatically refresh content after data updates, ensuring a real-time view of your document library.

Profile Search & Search Scopes: Advanced semantic and exact-match search capabilities. Features dynamic 'Search Scopes' to control the breadth and speed of database queries:
- Auto (Default): The system automatically routes the query to the most optimized Oracle database table based on the selected "Search Type" form and field configuration.
- Global (All Tables): Bypasses specific form routing and performs a comprehensive search across all associated tables. Returns a maximum number of records but can be significantly slower.
- Specific Forms (e.g., Form 3799, Form 2572): Forces the database to only query within that specific form's scope (like "Vehicles", "Files", or "Projects"), drastically improving search speeds when the profilesearch precisely knows the target category.
